        <h2><u>Basic Info</u></h2>
        <p>I am 16, and I live with my dad and his beagle puppy, Tater, and my cat, Theo.  My older brother graduated last year and has started his first year at RIT for an accelerated Master's in Engineering, planning to either focus on Electrical Engineering or Computer Engineering.</p>

        <h2><u>My interests</u></h2>

        <p>I like all kinds of stories, but I have not a lot of games that I like.  I currently play Wolf Quest Anniversary Edition and Coral Island, although I started video games by playing Minecraft on Xbox and ARK Survival Evolved on PC.</p>

        <h2><u>Something Fun</u></h2>
        <p>Last year, I went to Metallica concert in Syracuse with my dad, older brother, and uncles.  I also went to the New York State FFA Convention the past two years, as a delegate and as a competitor, and last year I returned with 16 free pots of chamomile.  I was allowed to take them since the organizer had to remove the plants from the planters, but didn't want to simply get rid of them.  So instead, she asked people to take the plants home with them, and I took as much chamomile as I could to try to make tea.</p>
